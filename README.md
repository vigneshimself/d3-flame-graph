Generated using a [D3.js plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/d3-flame-graph) that produces flame graphs from hierarchical data.

Check [Brendan Gregg's post](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html) to know what flame graphs are.

> Flame graphs are a visualization of profiled software, allowing the most frequent code-paths to be identified quickly and accurately. They can be generated using my open source programs on [github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph](http://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph), which create interactive SVGs.
